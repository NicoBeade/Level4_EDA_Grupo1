 * Implementation of a search engine for html pages
 * -The output of the program is based on the TF-IDF algorithm, which sorts the pages according 
 *  to how representative of a file is a given word. Note that the algorithm designed is BASED on
 *  TF-IDF, some modifications were made either in order to make the program more efficient or to
 *  decrease the complexity of developing the algorithm. We decided to skip the IDF part of the 
 *  algorithm due to the fact that it involved a lot more of additional computational time which
 *  made response times way higher.
 * @cite https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HuKFh0BatQ
 * -There was another layer of complexity that could have been added to the program. 
 *  an innitial design of ours involved detecting whether a word was in the header or in the body
 *  of an html so that we could reward the presence of the searched word in the headers of the html.
 *  This involved a more complex parser that was initially written, but we opted out parsing every-
 *  thing into a single string instead of separating headers from body. This parser can still be 
 *  found however in the class EDAoogleHttpRequestHandler in case future designs wanted to incorpo-
 *  rate this functionality. The method's name is filterHTMLContent.
 *
 * 
 * A problem we encountered but could not solve:
 * There is a problem when searching with unicode characters, which arises from html encoding in
 * html entities. We tried installing a library to encode the search string but we got nowhere and
 * could not solve this issue after several attempts. This problem could have been solved as well 
 * by doing the parsing of the html files with an external library, but we decided instead to 
 * write the parser ourselves. 
 * 
 * 
 * USED LIBRARIES
 * 
 * sqlite3 - Install by writting vcpkg install sqlite3 in a console
 * find_package(unofficial-sqlite3 CONFIG REQUIRED)
 * target_link_libraries(edahttpd PRIVATE unofficial::sqlite3::sqlite3)
 * THIS LIBRARY WAS USED TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM SQL SEARCHES
